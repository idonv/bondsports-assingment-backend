* 4 get an account statement of the transactions by calling the /account/{accountId}/statement endpoint.

* 5 block the account by calling /account/{accountId}/block.

* 5 try any of the endpoints (balance, statement, block, deposit, withdraw) to get a Forbidden response becouse the account is now blocked.

  

## UML diagrams

  

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

  

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram

AccountsController ->> AccountsService: createAccount

AccountsService ->> AccountCreationExecutor: run (account & client SQL transaction)

AccountCreationExecutor->> DB: INSERT (to accounts table & people table)

AccountCreationExecutor--> AccountsService: returns Account Entity

AccountsService--> AccountsController: returns Account Entity

  

```

  

flow of the components relations:

  

```mermaid
